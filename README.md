## 5. Multi-Step Use Case (Workflow)  

### 🔄 End-to-End Workflow

   │
   │ (2) Extract data
   ▼
Validation (ERP: SAP / Oracle / Odoo)
   │
   │ (3) Match with Purchase Order
   ▼
Approval Workflow (Manager/Dept Head)
   │
   │ (4) Approve / Reject
   ▼
Payment Processing (Bank API / Stripe Treasury)

6. Development Approach
🛠️ Tools & Integrations
Invoice Capture → OCR APIs (AWS Textract, Google Vision AI).

Validation → ERP APIs (SAP, Oracle NetSuite, Odoo).

Approval Routing → Workflow engine (Zapier, n8n, Node.js microservice).

Payments → Bank APIs (Plaid, Wise, Stripe Treasury).

Reconciliation → QuickBooks/Xero APIs.

Dashboard → BI (Power BI, Tableau, Metabase).

📡 Data Flow
Supplier → Email Invoice → OCR → ERP Validation → Approval Workflow → Payment Gateway → ERP Ledger → BI Dashboard

7. Failure Modes
⚠️ Potential Risks & Recovery

API Downtime (OCR/ERP/Banking)

Mitigation: Implement retry queue with exponential backoff.

Alert finance team with real-time Slack/Email notification.

Data Extraction Errors (OCR Misread)

Mitigation: Flag “low-confidence fields” for manual review.

Build human-in-the-loop validation step.

8. Security & Privacy
🔒 Sensitive Data Handling

Invoices contain vendor banking details & tax info.

Use TLS 1.2+ encryption for all API communication.

Store files in encrypted storage (AWS S3 + KMS).

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) → only finance team access.

Maintain immutable audit logs for SOX/GDPR compliance.

9. Rollout Plan
📅 Phase-Wise Implementation

Phase 1 (Pilot) → Automate invoice capture + validation for 1 vendor group.

Phase 2 (Department Rollout) → Extend to all vendors; add approval workflows.

Phase 3 (Scale) → Automate payments & reconciliation; integrate BI dashboards.

Phase 4 (Optimization) → Add anomaly detection (AI) to prevent fraud/duplicates.
